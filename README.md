# Landing Page

### *Project Overview*
This is a modern responsive landing page built using HTML, SCSS, and CSS Grid. The project uses SCSS mixins for reusable styles and Grid for a structured, flexible layouts.

### *Technologies Used*
-  HTML –  Structure of the page
-  SCSS – Variables, Mixins, Nesting
-  CSS Grid – Layout design
-  Flexbox – Responsive elements
-  JavaScript – Interactive elements

I created a responsive layout using SCSS mixins for Grid and media queries. The project follows a modular structure, where each element has its own SCSS component for better maintainability. For interactivity, JavaScript is used to handle the menu functionality and slider effects.
